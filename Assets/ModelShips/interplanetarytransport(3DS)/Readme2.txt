All modeling and texturing by Michael Hobson.

This mesh can be used in PERSONAL, NON-COMMERCIAL projects only.  Any images or animations created with this model MUST include proper credits.

This 3DS file was converted using 3D Exploration, and may not contain all texture coordinates.  Most of the texturing of the original mesh used several of LightWave's procedural textures, which do not convert to other formats.  If you convert/retexture this model, please let me know so I can post it fully textured on my website.

int_transport.3ds - the mesh
