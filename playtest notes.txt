Add bounds script again -- fix it up

really hard to get object when CONSTANTLY moving
controls on keyboard are inverted

really fast moving
seemed a bit confusing to figure out what was going on

when you press down on the keyboard you go up? -- inverted 

doesn't seem fair when the other player gets the flag -- the other person is screwed
brake or sharp turn?

maybe would be a lot easier with a mouse

you should have some kind of handicap when you have the flag

-- maybe making more asteroids because no one really ran into them at all

you get stuck on planets and once ur stuck then ur stuck forever --> because you're always moving forward so you can't get off 

moving too fast
hard to hit another player or get teh target
found themselves circling around target a few times just narrowly missing it 

super fast

inverted controls aren't bad
some people don't like some people do

standard no boost speed is wayyy too fast... it becomes hard to control ship

***need to remember to put bounds back in so you can't get too far away in space

what if time slowed down?
more powerful projectiles
slow the game down

after you use boost and release you stop moving forward at all

you feel like you should be using right control stick for something but it does nothing

shrinking the environment a lot

maybe making the cargo much bigger and shrink it when u actually get it

limit boost
adding brakes - unlimited

you have trouble doing damage
certain things in certain layers only show up in certain layers

make it more clear that you need to get the flag
planets look cool

make it more distinct when you die
keep track of how many times you get the cargo to your home base

****play the star wars game like this

making more to the environment 
see crimson skies -- that had more things in it

space is big and you need to move fast through it to get anywhere

whats fun about this kind of game?
really strip away everything else except that one thing and focus on that
